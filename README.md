## What's a Github Profile-README?

Apparently 'www.github.com/#your-username/#your-username' is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile.
The GitHub profile-level README feature allows more content than the profile bio, supports markdown which means you can play around with 
the content more visually and the README is significantally more visible as it is placed above pinned repositories
and takes up as much space above the fold of the webpage as you like.

## How do I create a Profile-README?

The Profile README is created by creating a new repo that’s the same name as your username.
This is how it works:

1.Create a repo with your github username (e.g. https://github.com/#your-username/#your-username)
 For example, my GitHub username is suryachaitanya0 so ,I created a new repo with the name suryachaitanya0.(the letter-casing must match your GitHub username.)
One thing to note: If you already have a project in a repo-named #username/#username and are interested in setting up a profile-level README, then I recommend re-naming 
 that repository.

2.Create a README.md file inside the repo

3.Add content(introduction text,banner, links, GIFs, images, emojis, etc.), and commit the file

4.Commit your new README!
If you're on GitHub's web interface you can choose to commit directly to the repo's main branch (i.e., master or main) which will make it immediately 
visible on your profile) or Push changes to GitHub if you made changes locally (i.e., on your computer).

That's it.

## What to add to your README?

1.A Greeting message

2.Bio or self-description(try to keep it simple)

3.Make your page memorable by Adding Images, Icons and GIF to make the page look bit dynamic, instead of just filling it with text.
 
	You can also add a hero image(a large banner at the top of your page.)
	This is the first thing that people will see when they visit, so make it enticing!

4.Include Stats

	If you are using Github for your projects or use it to contribute to open source, you probably have a lot of commits and Pull Requests.
	Anurag Hazra created this amazing widget which compiles all those stats into one!
	you can include yout stats like commits,pull requests etc

5.Include Top language card

6.You are not limited to Markdown when it comes to editing your README. Github's Flavored Markdown allows using some of the HTML tags.
Here's some of the basic things you can do:
	Center a section using <center>
	Create a widget that opens and closes using <details>

5.Want to link to external sites? Add some icons which redirect to your social networks or projects.
I recommend using the free and open source RemixIcon library and just changed the color to suit the color scheme.
One thing to note: Make sure your images are of great quality. We wouldn't want images to show up pixelated.
If you are using vector images, upload them using SVG instead of JPG or PNG.

7.Profile visitors counter
